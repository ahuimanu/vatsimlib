# VATSIMLIB

VATSIM exposes a number of data services via REST APIs.  Many of these have updated in 2021.  This library is meant to consume each of these services for subsequent application reuse.

## VATSIM Services

Here are some of the services:

* [V3 Data Server JSON Feed](https://api.vatsim.dev/)
* [VATSIM API](https://api.vatsim.net/api/) - requires key

This library initially focuses on the data feed as metar and pilot lookups are provided within that API.
